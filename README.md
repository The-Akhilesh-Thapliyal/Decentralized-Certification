Decentralized Certification is a decentralized application (dApp) designed for secure and efficient certificate management. Leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and React for the frontend, this application empowers users to securely download certificates while incorporating PDF watermarking for enhanced security.



## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent certificate management.
- **PDF Watermarking**: Adds a unique watermark to downloaded PDF certificates for heightened security.
- **Responsive UI**: Delivers an intuitive and responsive user interface for seamless interaction.
## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization:

- **`src/`**: Contains the React frontend source code.
  - **`jsx/`**: Houses React components integral to the application.
  - **`contracts/`**: Holds Ethereum smart contract JSON files.
  - **`css/`**: Custom styles designed for the application.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions for blockchain interaction, PDF manipulation, and form handling.
- **`public/`**: Includes static assets and serves as the HTML entry point for the React application.
- **`package.json`**: Node.js project configuration file.
- **`README.md`**: Comprehensive project documentation.## Prerequisites
